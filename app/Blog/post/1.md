# Hello World ðŸš€

This is my very first blog post written in Markdown inside Next.js.

## My Journey
I started with **Java Full Stack**, then moved to **MERN** and built real projects.

### Key Learnings
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals
- React and Next.js for frontend
- Node.js, Express, MongoDB/Postgres for backend

## Adding a YouTube Video
You can embed like this:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"  
title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Adding a Local Video
If you place a video in `public/videos/intro.mp4`, you can do:

<video controls width="600">
  <source src="/videos/intro.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
