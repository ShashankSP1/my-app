description: "Working on real-world projects like Villagepepro (fintech) and Neuva Life Sciences (e-commerce) gave me hands-on experience with frontend and backend development. I used React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL to build features like payment integrations, authentication, and product catalogs. These projects taught me how to collaborate, debug efficiently, and manage complexity."
